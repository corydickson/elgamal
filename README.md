# elgamal

This is an example showing an ecryption scheme for plaintext strings over the JubJub elliptic curve group implemented [here](https://github.com/zkcrypto/jubjub). It accomplishes this by taking a max 256-bit, utf-8 encoded string, and uses a probabilistic mapping
to determine a possible `x` coordinate on the curve. When one is found, this point represents the message and is used to
compute the part of the cypher that contains the shared secret [generated by Bob in the scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption).
